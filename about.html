    <p> There are so many things that i would love to tell you about me but i am going to keep it very simple. As you already know my name is Mone't. I was born in Rhode Island and went to Saint Raphael Academy for high school. 
      In high school i was very focused and devoted my life to basketball. I played AAU basketball and basketball for my school. After i graduated highschool it made me realize that life is not always about sports.
      Coming into the University of Rhode Island i had no idea what i wanted to major in. At first i was very interested in Kinesiology and declared the major at the beggining of my sophomore year at URI. At the end of my my 
      sophomore year is when i realized that is not what i wanted to do and did not see myself using the major in the future. After doing some research on the different majors offered at URI, i finally found computer science.
        Outside of school i have so many hobbies!I love to hangout with my friends and drive around and do fun stuff. I also enjoy hanging with my family and my puppy. During quarantine i managed to convince my mother to allow me to 
        buy a dog. She is a golden doodle, which is a golden retriever and a poodle mixed. Her name is Biscuit. I also have a cat whose name is Nala. My everyday life is a very different everyday and that is something i truly enjoy about 
        being myself. I like to think of it as everyday being a surprise because i never know whats going to happen next.</p>
